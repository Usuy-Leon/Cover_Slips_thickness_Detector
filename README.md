# Cover_Slips_thickness_Detector_Shinya-blades_

>“In good Objectives, small departures in cover glass thickness or refractive index produce a disproportionately large optical path error, reducing image contrast and resolution.”
— Inoué, S. & Spring, K. R., Video Microscopy, 2nd ed., Plenum Press (1997), §2.5.2

This gadget is like a tiny playground for cover slips, featuring two razor-thin steel blades acting as barriers, with a shim creating a precise offset. When you drop a cover slip into the gap,  Geometry happens and makes the cover slip to tilt depending on its thickness. Even hair-thin differences in thickness become easy-to-read

# Why does it matter?

Cover-slip thickness is critically important in microscopy because high-resolution optical systems are designed for specific optical path lengths between the specimen and the objective lens. Even small deviations from that ideal thickness can cause spherical aberration, loss of contrast, and degraded resolution.

Yes, professional manufacturers nowadays do a decent job of reporting cover-slip thickness correctly (Types 0 to 2). However, not all producers follow these standards, so having a tool like this can be really useful especially when working with objectives designed for specimens very close to the cover slip (corrected for 0.17 mm thickness). If you happen to use a cover slip that’s too thick, you could accidentally scratch your very expensive objective in an irreversible way.

# The Microscopist: Shinya Inoue 

>“In fluorescence, phase-contrast, or quantitative polarization microscopy, consistent optical path length ensures reproducible intensity and retardation measurements”
— Inoué, S., Collected Works, Article 4: Cover-Slip Thickness Gauge (1951)
.
That’s why Shinya Inoué built his cover-slip thickness gauge (1951): to quickly select slips within ±0.005 mm of 0.17 mm. (Check the paper atached in files)

In 1950, while teaching cell biology at Princeton University, Shinya Inoué realized that commercial “#1.5” cover slips, however, often varied by several micrometers. Measuring each one with a micrometer was slow and risked contamination, so Inoué devised a simple mechanical gauge in 1951.

His device used two razor blades set at a fixed angle: the cover slip itself acted as a tiny lever, tilting according to its thickness. A scale converted that tilt into a direct reading in millimeters—fast, clean, and accurate to a few microns.

Remarkably, the same gauge built more than 70 years ago was still in use in Inoué’s laboratory half a century later—a small but elegant example of his ingenuity in combining optical precision with practical design.
